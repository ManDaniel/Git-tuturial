            <h1>These adorable puppies may help explain why dogs understand our body language</h1>
            <small>DAVID GRIMM</small>
            <p>The researchers put the puppies through three tests. First, they performed a classic pointing experiment, placing the young dogs between two overturned cups—one containing a treat—and pointing to the one with the treat (see video, above). The animals understood the gesture more than two-thirds of the time, approaching the performance of adult dogs. But they didn't get any better over a dozen rounds, suggesting they were not learning the behavior, MacLean says.

                In a second experiment, a researcher stood outside a large playpen and, for 30 seconds, engaged in the kind of high-pitched "puppy talk" familiar to almost anyone who has owned a dog: "Hey puppy, look at you! You're such a good puppy." The animals spent an average of 6 seconds staring at the person. Such eye contact is rare among mammals—including the pups' ancestors, gray wolves—and it's an important foundation for social interaction with people.</p>

            <h3>Puppies!!!</h3>

            <p>In a final test, the researchers taught the puppies to find food in a plastic container, then sealed it with a lid. In contrast to adult dogs, which usually give up after a few seconds and look to humans for assistance, the pups rarely gazed at their scientist companions for help. "Puppies seem to be sensitive to receiving information from humans," as the other experiments show, MacLean says, "but they may not yet know that that they can solicit help from us.”</p>
