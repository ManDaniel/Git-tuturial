Establishing a Facebook business page grants access to valuable business tools. Facebook's Insights feature generates real-time user data, analyzing each post made and breaking down its effectiveness within your customer base. Insights reveals your visitors' age, gender, location and how they came to your page so you can fine tune your marketing strategy and hit your target audience. Facebook also provides business pages with advertising and promotion options, helping give you an edge on the competition.
